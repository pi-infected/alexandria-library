Portable Alexandria Library

In the event that part or all of the Internet becomes inoperative, the human knowledge accumulated during this century and the previous one would be lost. This would be the case for the least privileged part of the population. Without a civilizational base, the fragmented communities of the population would have to rediscover what we already know collectively. The goal is to deploy in various communities aware of the changes to come, a materially inexpensive and energy-efficient system that allows to search for information (in the manner of a Google) in the set of primordial human knowledge:

* Encyclopedias wikipedia, wiki-how (tutorials)
* Educational material for all stages (from primary to higher education).
* Databases of scientific articles (from 1 to 10 million on all subjects)
* Databases of books (from 1 to 10 million on all subjects).
* A set of tutorials to build the basic elements of a community (food, energy, agriculture / permaculture, structures ...)

The current goal of the project is to produce :

A computer capable of storing this data and especially of being able to search efficiently in it (otherwise it is unusable). The order of magnitude of the data to be stored is 50 to 100 terabytes. A set of e-book reader to be able to study the documents over time after having found them (almost no energy expenditure).

This could be the nerve center of the knowledge of a village or a community, which would allow it to develop with the help of our knowledge on all subjects. We have to realize that with the internet, we have no autonomy and organization of knowledge without the internet. If it were to be cut off, for whatever reason, we would not know (and know how to do) much.

This repository is a work in progress. It is undocumented up to now.
